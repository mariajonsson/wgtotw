wgtotw
=========

A PHP-based and MVC-inspired (micro) framework / webbtemplate / boilerplate for a website forum.

Wgtotw is built using Anax-MVC as base. Anax-MVC has been extended with database support (cdatabase module), forms (cform module), content management and users.

Read article about Anax-MVC here: ["Anax som MVC-ramverk"](http://dbwebb.se/kunskap/anax-som-mvc-ramverk) and here ["Bygg en me-sida med Anax-MVC"](http://dbwebb.se/kunskap/bygg-en-me-sida-med-anax-mvc).

Wgtotw is by Maria Jonsson.

Install and setup
-------------------

Clone repository from GitHub.
The webroot folder is the web page's root folder.

### Settings

Some files need to be modified in order for the website to work.

* `webroot/.htaccess`  
  Settings for clean URLs. #Rewrite module must be on for clean urls to work. Change base url in #Rewrite base if necessary.
* `app/config/config_mysql.php`  
  Change the settings for MySQL. This file is referred to from webroot/index.php
* `webroot/css/anax-wgtotw`  
  This folder must be writable (chmod 777) for style.php and .less styles to work.

### Setup

You need to set up the database before you can use the website (ie content and user management). 

In your web browser, type in: `[installation path]/webroot/setup`  
The script will create tables and some example content (users, questions, answers, comments, tags). You should see the database output.

Using the site
---------------------

### Users and content

It is possible for a site visitor to create and activate their own user account.

A user can add and edit their own content (questions, answers, comments, user profile). (Except for editing tags). 

An administrator can edit all content (except currently for editing tags). Currently there is only one possible admin: a user with the username "admin". 

Users can vote (+1 or -1) for questions, answers and comments that they approve of or disapprove of. 

A user who posts a question can select one "accepted answer" from the answers they receive for their question.
